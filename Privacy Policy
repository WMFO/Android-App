We use technologies such as unique device identifiers to anonymously identify your device so we can deliver a better experience. In the event that our app should crash, our systems log information like your device model, as well as a small section of your device's log data to find out what went wrong. This log data could potentially contain personal or otherwise private information. All log data is deleted after the cause of error has been understood, or after two (2) weeks.

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number or email address.

We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.

Our systems are designed to retain log data for up to two (2) weeks after it is collected. We remove personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email or phone number) and other preferences associated with you promptly.

We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting.

We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.

Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.
